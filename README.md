# REPO TO TEST ON MY GITHUB PAGE THINGS

### I mainly use this repo to test a bunch of random things that I end up showing on the linked Github Page.
 > Right now what the Github Page is showing is a command list that is used on my forked version of  NadekoBot that I solfhosted and have running on my Discord Server. 

The page is just displaying the data of a CSV file that has all the commands that the bot uses. 


### Extra Info

> If you wanna learn how to run your own instance of NadekoBot check their guide : https://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/linux-guide/ my instance is running on Ubuntu Server which is running on my old computer. I used tmux to install and configured the bot since I had some trouble with pm2 not running on system restart.
